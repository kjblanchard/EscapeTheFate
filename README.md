## Details

- BGMs created by me in Garageband
- Wrote entirely in vim, to get better at raw vim, debugged with lldb or remdebug.

## Goals

- Cross Platform cmake
- Package with cmake for installing on desktops
- C/Lua practice
- Learn OpenGL
- Better with vim

## Installation

- Run any of the make commands for your platform, or run cmake directly,
    currently this bundles the demo game and engine together

    ```bash
    make rebuild
    ```
